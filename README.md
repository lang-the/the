Since it's private programming language it will be available only via cli, your
project files will be sent to servers, compiled and respond with binaries.

> Your project files are deleted once compiled and are not shared with any 3rd
> party and nor by The Programming Language itself, this process is needed to
> ensure safety of The Programming Language source code.
