# The Programming Language
This is the official repository of The Programming Language. \
The Programming Language is a rapid, minimalistic, elegant, high-performance,
high-level programming language.
- **Unique:** The syntax was produced by a combination of best features of all
  known programming languages in the world
- **Fast:** Speed of programs produced by The Programming Language is so fast
  that comparable with writing applications in Assembly
- **Helpful:** The Programming Language takes care of everything for you, so
  that you can focus on writing code
- **Independent:** To compile your code The Programming Language doesn't use
  any 3rd party dependencies
- **Portable:** The Programming Language works on
  [many](#supported-operating-systems) operating systems

## Goals
1. Be the only programming language used across the world
2. Support every possible scenario of development with less effort from
  developer
3. Centralize development around The Programming Language by providing
  building, deployment and testing tools

## Explanation
We strongly believe that in programming there should be only one programming
language - The Programming Language and term "programming language" should
directly refer to The Programming Language. \
The reason for not having other programming languages is very simple: they are
simply not needed, The Programming Language can do any job other programming
languages are doing.

## How to contribute
To contribute, please send us a [pull
request](https://github.com/lang-the/the/compare) from your fork of this
repository. \
New developers may find notes in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file
helpful to start contributing.

## Using
In order to use The Programming Language please refer to
[CLI](https://github.com/lang-the/cli).

## File extension
The Programming Language don't have file extension, The Programming Language
created to serve as main programming language. If your files don't have files
extensions you have only 2 options:

1. shell script - The Programming Language can accomplish any task shell script
  can, in future we expect to replace shell scripts
2. binary files - nowadays most of the time binaries have file extensions
  `.out`, `.app` or `.exe` which are visible to user. It's very rare to find
  binary having no file extension on your Desktop

It means that spot for having no file extension is reserved by The Programming
Language starting from 2021-03-23.

## Supported Operating Systems
The Programming Language is built and tested on the following operating
systems:

| Operating System | Version       | Architecture     | Support       |
|:---------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| MacOS            | 10.10 - 11.3  | Intel x86-64     | Official      |
|                  | 11.0  - 11.3  | Apple Silicon    | Not tested    |
| Linux            | -             | -                | Not tested    |
| Windows          | -             | -                | Not tested    |
