# The Programming Language
This is the official repository of The Programming Language. \
The Programming Language is a rapid, minimalistic, elegant, high-performance,
high-level programming language.
- **Unique:** The syntax was produced by a combination of best features of all
  known programming languages in the world
- **Fast:** The speed is so fast that comparable with writing applications in
  Assembly
- **Helpful:** The Programming Language takes care of everything for you, so
  that you can focus on writing code
- **Independent:** To compile your code The Programming Language doesn't use
  any 3rd party dependency
- **Portable:** The Programming Language works on a large number of operating
  systems

## Explanation
We strongly believe that in programming there should be only one programming
language - The Programming Language and term "programming language" should
directly refer to The Programming Language. \
The reason for not having other programming languages is very simple: nowadays
many languages compile to other language before being compiled to machine code
(C programming language compiles to Assembly, Assembly compiles to object file,
object file to machine code). It's not to say about languages such as Swift,
Kotlin, JavaScript whom chain of compiled objects is very long. \
The Programming Language, on the other hand, compiles directly to machine code
removing dependencies like: `nasm`, `ld`, `clang`, `gcc`, etc \
And now a question for you, reader, why would you use any other programming
language if all features supported by modern programming languages are
supported by The Programming Language which compiles directly to machine code
without any delays?

## How to contribute
To contribute, please send us a [pull
request](https://github.com/lang-the/the/compare) from your fork of this
repository. \
New developers may find notes in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file
helpful to start contributing.

## Using
In order to use The Programming Language please refer to
[CLI](https://github.com/lang-the/cli).

## File extension
The Programming Language don't have file extension, it's created to serve as
main programming language. If your files don't have files extensions you have
only 2 options:

1. shell script - The Programming Language can accomplish any task shell script
  can, in future we expect to replace shell scripts
2. binary files - nowadays most of the time binaries have file extensions
  `.out`, `.app` or `.exe` which are visible to user. It's very rare to find
  binary having no file extension on your Desktop

It means that spot for having no file extension is reserved by The Programming
Language starting from 2021-03-23.

## Supported Operating Systems
Since the compiler is written in The Programming Language, it must be built by
a precompiled previous version of itself. \
The Programming Language is built and tested on the following operating
systems:

| Operating System | Version      | Architecture     | Support       |
|:---------------- | ------------ | ---------------- | ------------- |
| MacOS            | 10.10 - 11.3 | Intel x86-64     | Official      |
|                  | -            | Apple Silicon    | Not tested    |
| Linux            | -            | -                | Not tested    |
| Windows          | -            | -                | Not tested    |
