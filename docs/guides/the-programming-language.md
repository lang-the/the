The Programming Language name means that it's simple has no name, unlike other
programming languages which were created to solve specific developer problems,
The Programming Language aim to help developer with any task at any stage of
development.

> ### Aaron Delasy
  I created The Programming Language because deep in my heart I believe there
  should be only one programming language for all possible tasks and stages
  of development. \
  By the time of writing this article I know and have used around fifteen
  programming languages. Honestly, it was a pain to learn every new language
  just because it's better to achieve goal X. Instead, I decided to create
  programming language that will solve all the developer needs.
