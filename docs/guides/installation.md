The Programming Language doesn't require user to install it, all the
compilation is performed on cloud servers. Instead, we recommend installing
CLI, here's how to do it:

```bash
$ curl -o- https://cdn.thelang.io/cli | bash
```

Yes! It's just one command, we take all the hassle on us and let developer
focus on writing code. \
Verify installation by running:

```bash
$ the -v
```

To learn better what commands you can use, run next command:

```bash
$ the -h
```
